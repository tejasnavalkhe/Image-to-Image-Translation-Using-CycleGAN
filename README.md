# Image-to-Image-Transfer-Learning-CycleGAN-of-Human-Faces-to-Cat-Dog-Faces

## About Project:

• Implemented a CycleGAN model using the PyTorch library to translate human face images to cat/dog images.

• After Cloning CycleGAN repository and installing all required libraries but before commencing the training process, organized four folders for training and testing images, each corresponding to two domains.

• Chose to run the training for 30 epochs to ensure that transfer learning occurs effectively. Performed testing of the CycleGAN model on the remaining images.

• Finally, the results were visualized through plotting, confirming the successful implementation of CycleGAN.
